	   <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the length of the input. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that optimize performance.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run relative to the input size. It is measured in terms of O(n), where n represents the input size. Optimizing Space Complexity ensures better utilization of system resources.</p>
